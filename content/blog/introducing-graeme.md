## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my first blog post! My name is Graeme, and I am a refrigeration engineer by trade, with 17 years experiance but my real passion lies in the world of technology. Over the years, I have been able to spend more time on my hobby and I am excited to share my journey with you.

Growing up, I always had an interest in how things worked. My dad was in the refrigeration industry and when I finished school, I decided to follow in his footsteps. I joined a 4-year apprenticeship and have since been working in the industry, traveling the world and gaining experience with some of the most advanced equipment out there.

While I am grateful for my job in the refrigeration industry, it is not my true passion. That all started at the age of 13, when I used to visit a local PC shop after school. I would spend my time building and repairing computers, and that's where I was first introduced to the world of online gaming.

Darren, the part-owner of the computer shop. He also enjoyed online gaming, and it wasn't long before I picked up my first GPU and started playing Tom Clancy's Ravenshield. I soon found myself part of the clan GSU (Global Strike Unit) and was reporting for duty.

From there I discovered the massive multiplayer online first-person shooter (FPSMMO) game, Planetside. It was ahead of its time and provided some of the best online gaming experiences I have ever had. The community was tight-knit and I joined a clan called ISK (Immortal Serial Killers). I was soon tasked with setting up a PHPBB forum board for the clan to communicate, that's where my passion for building and creating really took off. I didnt just want a generic theme, i got to building a unique custom theme.

## Building Websites for Gaming Clans
I started my journey by creating custom themed user signatures and avatars for gaming forums using Photoshop. My skills quickly gained recognition and I began receiving requests from other members to create similar designs for them. This led me to expand my services to include building complete websites for gaming clans. I started by creating custom skins for existing forums and then eventually moved on to building a custom Content Management Systems (CMS) which i used for each of my clients. Over time, I have had the privilege of building websites for several gaming clans, and it has been an incredibly rewarding experience. I take pride in delivering high-quality, user-friendly websites that not only meet but exceed my clients' expectations.

## Taking Time Out and Traveling
After some time, I decided to take a break and traveled to South America and then immigrated to New Zealand.

## Driven by the Open-Source Community
Today, my passion lies in the open-source and self-hosted community. I am fascinated by the collective contribution and the opportunity to make a real impact. With my engineering background, I have a logical approach to the way I work and I enjoy the challenge of coding and fault-finding. I find it satisfying to build and make changes and see the results.

## Future Goals and Projects
My future goals are to continue learning and expanding my knowledge in the world of technology and open-source. I am currently working on a follow-up blog post which will include my self-hosted apps, network setup and the benefits it has provided me with in terms of online security and convienence.

I am grateful for the journey that has led me to where I am today. From a refrigeration engineer to a tech enthusiast, my passion for technology and gaming has only continued to grow. I hope this blog post has given you a glimpse into my journey and I can't wait to see where the future takes me.
