# Hello! [üëã]{.wave} 

A refrigeration engineer by day and a web development hobbyist by night. I live in the peaceful country of :icon{name="twemoji:flag-new-zealand" class="ml-2 mr-1" alt="New Zealand Flag"} New Zealand, having migrated from the :icon{name="twemoji:flag-england" class="ml-2 mr-1" alt="England Flag"} UK.

Sometimes I [write articles](/blog){title="Visit Blog Page"}.

When I'm not coding, you can find me;
::list
- üêï taking Ada for walks
- üìö reading about new projects
- üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è home workout (calisthenics)
- üéÆ playing games
- üèûÔ∏è or perhaps enjoying the scenery in front of a waterfall.

## About

My passion for web development started at the age of 13, when I would assist in a local PC repair shop after school. It wasn't long before I built my own computer and got hooked on online gaming, which led to creating websites and forums for the gaming community. 
Today, i am driven by the passion of the collective contribution from the self hosted and open source community. This keeps me plenty busy with personal projects to improve the quality of life in this advanced world we now live in. With that in mind, I specialize in working with the VueJS, Nuxt, and Vite ecosystems.

If you want to know more about my work, you can take a tour of the [Projects page](/projects).

## Paid Work

In my free time, I work as a freelancer, creating UX web apps using Nuxt for my clients. 

If you think I could help with your project, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:keyboarddabbler@gmail.com){title="Send an email to me at keyboarddabbler@gmail.com"}.
